## Architecture

### Core Structure
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with App Router
- **Languages**: TypeScript with strict configuration (noUnusedLocals, noUnusedParameters, exactOptionalPropertyTypes)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4 with PostCSS
- **Internationalization**: next-intl for i18n routing and content
- **Animations**: Framer Motion for UI animations
- **Error Tracking**: Sentry integration for production monitoring

### Key Directories
- `web/` - Main Next.js application (all npm commands run from here)
- `web/app/[locale]/` - Internationalized route structure
- `web/messages/` - Translation files (fr.json, en.json)
- `web/components/` - React components including BusinessCarousel, ErrorBoundary, compliance tools
- `web/content/` - MDX content files for guides and documentation
- `web/lib/` - Utility functions and configurations
- `Documents/` - Business documentation (BusinessPlanV0.5.md, roadmap)
- `Plans/` - Project improvement plans

### Internationalization Setup
- **Default locale**: French (`fr`)
- **Supported locales**: `['fr', 'en']`
- **Routing**: Always prefixed (`/fr/`, `/en/`)
- **Middleware**: Automatic locale detection and routing
- **Configuration**: `i18n.ts` and `i18n/request.ts` handle locale resolution

## Development Commands

All commands must be run from the `web/` directory:

```bash
cd web

# Development
npm run dev                    # Start dev server with Turbopack
npm run build                  # Production build
npm run start                  # Start production server

# Testing
npm run test                   # Run Vitest tests
npm run test:ui                # Vitest UI
npm run test:run               # Run tests once
npm run test:a11y              # Run Playwright accessibility tests
npm run test:a11y:headed       # Run accessibility tests with browser

# Linting & Validation
npm run lint                   # Run ESLint
npm run lint:fix               # Auto-fix ESLint issues
npm run i18n:lint              # Validate translation files
npm run content:validate       # Validate content structure

# Analysis
npm run analyze                # Bundle analyzer for both client and server
npm run analyze:server         # Server bundle analysis
npm run analyze:browser        # Browser bundle analysis
```

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Vitest with React Testing Library (`__tests__/` directory)
- **Accessibility Tests**: Playwright with axe-core (`tests/accessibility.spec.ts`)
- **Test Config**: `vitest.config.ts` with jsdom environment
- **Run single test**: `npm run test -- path/to/test.spec.ts`

## Code Quality

### ESLint Configuration
- Extends Next.js core-web-vitals and TypeScript configs
- Import sorting with `simple-import-sort` plugin
- Consistent type imports enforced
- Custom rules in `eslint.config.mjs`

### Git Hooks
- **Husky**: Pre-commit hooks configured
- **Lint-staged**: Runs ESLint on staged files before commit
- Configuration in `package.json` lint-staged section

### TypeScript Configuration
- Strict mode enabled with additional checks
- Path alias: `@/*` maps to project root
- Incremental compilation for faster builds
- Excludes test files and scripts from compilation

## Content Management

### MDX Support
- MDX files supported for content pages
- Configuration in `next.config.ts` with `@next/mdx`
