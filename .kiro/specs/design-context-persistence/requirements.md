# Design Context Persistence Requirements

## Introduction

This feature ensures that when users navigate from the home page (BusinessCarousel) to other pages, the selected business design theme is preserved across the entire user journey. This creates a cohesive, branded experience where colors, styling, and behavior remain consistent with the user's selected industry design.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Design State Persistence

**User Story:** As a user viewing a specific business design on the home page, I want all subsequent pages to maintain the same visual theme and behavior, so that I have a consistent branded experience throughout my navigation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is viewing a specific business design on the home page THEN the system SHALL remember the current design selection
2. WHEN a user clicks on any navigation menu item THEN the system SHALL pass the current design context to the destination page
3. WHEN a user lands on any page with design context THEN the page SHALL apply the appropriate color palette and styling from that design
4. WHEN a user navigates between pages THEN the design context SHALL persist until they return to the home page and select a different design

### Requirement 2: URL-Based Design Context

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be able to share URLs that include the design context, so that others can see the same branded experience I'm viewing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a design is selected THEN the system SHALL include the design identifier in the URL parameters
2. WHEN a user visits a URL with a design parameter THEN the system SHALL apply that design theme to the page
3. WHEN a user shares a URL with design context THEN recipients SHALL see the same design theme
4. IF no design parameter is provided THEN the system SHALL use the default AI Agency design

### Requirement 3: Design Theme Application

**User Story:** As a user viewing pages in a specific design context, I want the colors, buttons, and cards to match the selected business design, so that the experience feels tailored to that industry.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a page loads with design context THEN the system SHALL apply the design's color palette to all UI elements
2. WHEN a page loads with design context THEN buttons SHALL use the design's accent colors and hover effects
3. WHEN a page loads with design context THEN cards SHALL use the design's styling and shadow effects
4. WHEN a page loads with design context THEN the hero sections SHALL use the design's gradient backgrounds

### Requirement 4: Navigation Context Preservation

**User Story:** As a user navigating through multiple pages, I want the design context to be maintained automatically, so that I don't lose the branded experience when moving between sections.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on navigation links THEN the system SHALL automatically include the current design context in the destination URL
2. WHEN a user uses browser back/forward buttons THEN the design context SHALL be preserved
3. WHEN a user opens links in new tabs THEN the design context SHALL be maintained
4. WHEN a user returns to the home page THEN they SHALL be able to select a different design and start a new themed journey

### Requirement 5: Fallback and Error Handling

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to gracefully handle cases where design context is missing or invalid, so that I always have a functional experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. IF an invalid design parameter is provided THEN the system SHALL default to the AI Agency design
2. IF design context is lost during navigation THEN the system SHALL default to the AI Agency design
3. WHEN design context cannot be applied THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue with default styling
4. WHEN a user accesses a page directly without design context THEN the system SHALL provide a way to select or return to the design selector

## Technical Considerations

- Design context should be stored in URL parameters for shareability
- Consider using React Context or similar state management for client-side persistence
- Each business design should have a defined theme configuration
- Pages should be able to dynamically apply theme styles
- Navigation components should automatically append design context to links

## Success Metrics

- Users can navigate through multiple pages while maintaining consistent design theme
- Shared URLs preserve the design context for recipients
- No visual inconsistencies when moving between pages in the same design context
- Smooth transitions between different design themes when users change selections
