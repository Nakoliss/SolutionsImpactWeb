# Design Document

## Overview

This design addresses comprehensive UI improvements for the BusinessCarousel component based on specific design requirements:
1. Reworking card titles in the "Agence IA — Plans modulaires pour leaders automatisation" section
2. Clarifying and implementing the "Voir le Design Agence IA" button functionality
3. Converting "Ce que nous livrons" section cards to modal-based interactions
4. Ensuring consistent close button (X) implementation across all modal designs

The solution maintains the existing component architecture while significantly enhancing user experience through improved content organization, interactive service exploration, and consistent modal behaviors.

## Architecture

The BusinessCarousel component currently has:
- Multiple modal rendering functions for different business designs
- Localized content loaded from JSON files and message files
- A modal state management system using `isModalOpen` state
- ServiceGrid component for displaying service catalogs
- Business design selector with theme switching

### Current Structure Analysis
- Main BusinessCarousel component with multiple sections
- Business design switching affects theming and content
- Service information displayed in cards and modals
- Mixed modal implementations across different business types

### Proposed Architecture Changes
- Enhanced modal system for "Ce que nous livrons" section
- Improved content structure for AI Agency section
- Standardized modal close button implementation
- Button functionality clarification and implementation

## Components and Interfaces

### 1. AI Agency Section Card Title Enhancement

**Current Implementation:**
- Section title: "Agence IA — Plans modulaires pour leaders automatisation"
- Card titles from business messages configuration
- Service cards with basic title and description structure

**Enhanced Implementation:**
- Updated section title to be more engaging and clear
- Reworked card titles to be more descriptive and value-focused
- Maintained localization support for French and English

**Content Structure:**
```typescript
// Enhanced business messages structure
interface BusinessDesignMessages {
  name: string;
  heroTitle: string;
  tagline: string;
  services: Record<string, string>; // Enhanced service titles
  ctaText: string;
  heroBadge: string;
}
```

### 2. "Voir le Design Agence IA" Button Clarification

**Current State:**
- Button exists with unclear functionality
- Needs clarification of intended behavior

**Design Decision Required:**
- Button purpose must be clarified before implementation
- Potential functions could include:
  - Opening a design showcase modal
  - Navigating to a design portfolio section
  - Triggering a design consultation flow
  - Switching to a specific business design view

**Implementation Approach:**
- Await clarification of button purpose
- Implement appropriate functionality once confirmed
- Ensure button provides clear user feedback
- Maintain consistency with overall design system

### 3. "Ce que nous livrons" Section Modal Conversion

**Current Implementation:**
- ServiceGrid component displays full service information in cards
- Services loaded from catalog with complete details visible

**Enhanced Modal-Based Implementation:**

**Card Structure:**
```typescript
interface ServiceCardSummary {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  shortDescription: string; // New: Brief summary for card display
  price?: string;
}
```

**Modal Structure:**
```typescript
interface ServiceModal {
  isOpen: boolean;
  serviceId: string | null;
  service: ServiceDetails | null;
}

interface ServiceDetails {
  title: string;
  fullDescription: string;
  tiers: ServiceTier[];
  features: string[];
  pricing: PricingInfo;
}
```

**Modal Behavior:**
- Cards display only title, short description, and price
- Click triggers modal with full service details
- Modal includes comprehensive information previously shown on cards
- Consistent modal styling across all services

### 4. Consistent Close Button Implementation

**Current State Analysis:**
- Mixed close button implementations across modals
- Inconsistent positioning and styling
- Some modals use X icon, others use different approaches

**Standardized Implementation:**
```typescript
interface ModalCloseButton {
  position: 'top-right';
  icon: 'X'; // Standardized X icon
  size: '24px';
  padding: '8px';
  hoverState: boolean;
  clickOutsideClose: boolean;
}
```

**Close Button Component:**
```tsx
const StandardCloseButton = ({ onClose, theme }: CloseButtonProps) => (
  <button
    onClick={onClose}
    className="absolute top-4 right-4 p-2 rounded-full hover:bg-opacity-20 transition-colors"
    style={{ color: theme.text, backgroundColor: `${theme.text}10` }}
    aria-label="Close modal"
  >
    <X size={20} />
  </button>
);
```

## Data Models

### Enhanced Service Data Structure
```typescript
interface EnhancedService {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  shortDescription: string; // For card display
  fullDescription: string; // For modal display
  headlinePrice?: string;
  tiers: ServiceTier[];
  features?: string[];
  category: string;
}

interface ServiceTier {
  name: string;
  price: string;
  setupCost?: string;
  features: string[];
  description?: string;
}
```

### Modal State Management
```typescript
interface ModalState {
  isBusinessModalOpen: boolean; // Existing business design modals
  isServiceModalOpen: boolean; // New service detail modals
  activeServiceId: string | null;
}
```

## Error Handling

### Content Loading
- Maintain existing fallback mechanism to French content if English fails
- Handle missing short descriptions gracefully with fallback to full description
- Ensure modal content loads properly even with incomplete service data

### Modal Interaction
- Preserve existing click-outside-to-close functionality
- Maintain keyboard accessibility (ESC key to close)
- Handle rapid modal opening/closing without state conflicts
- Ensure close button remains functional across all themes and screen sizes

### Button Functionality
- Provide appropriate error handling for "Voir le Design Agence IA" button
- Ensure graceful degradation if target functionality is unavailable
- Maintain user feedback for all button interactions
