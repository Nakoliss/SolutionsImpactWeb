# Bill 64 (Law 25) – Data-Residency Logic Guide

## 1. What is Bill 64 / Law 25?

- **Official name**: *Act to modernize legislative provisions as regards the protection of personal information*
- **In force**: September 22, 2022 (phased rollout through 2024)
- **Governs**: Any organisation that **collects, holds, uses, or discloses personal information of Quebec residents**, regardless of where the organisation is located.

## 2. Core Data-Residency & Transfer Rules

| Requirement | Practical Impact on Code & Infrastructure |
|---|---|
| **PIA before cross-border transfer** | You must document why data leaves Quebec and what safeguards are in place. |
| **"Comparable protection" standard** | If stored outside Quebec, encryption, access logging, breach detection, and contractual clauses are mandatory. |
| **Sub-processor list & contracts** | Every cloud, CDN, e-mail, or AI service that touches the data must sign a Quebec-compliant DPA (data-processing addendum). |
| **Data portability & erasure** | Provide endpoints or admin tools to export or fully delete any resident's data within **30 days** of request. |
| **Breach notification** | If data is outside Quebec, you must detect, log, and **auto-report to CAI** within **72 hours** of discovery. |

## 3. Technical Checklist for AI-Generated Projects

✅ Host primary database & backups in **Canada Central (Montreal) AWS, Azure, or Google**.

✅ Enable **server-side encryption at rest (AES-256)** and **TLS 1.2+ in transit**.

✅ Log **all access events** (IP, timestamp, user ID) with 1-year retention.

✅ Build **/export** and **/delete** endpoints for each personal-data entity.

✅ Create **alert webhooks** to your incident-response channel if breach thresholds are met.

## 4. What AI Cannot Automate (N/A)

- Performing the **legal sufficiency review** of hosting regions.
- Drafting **custom DPA clauses** for each sub-processor.
- Deciding if a given encryption or tokenisation regime satisfies "comparable protection".

> *Always have a Quebec-licensed privacy lawyer or DPO review the final design before go-live.*

## 5. Specific Compliance Requirements

### Data Residency
- **Primary storage**: Canada Central (Montreal region)
- **Backups**: Must also reside in Canada
- **Logging**: Access log retention for minimum 1 year

### Technical Security
- **Encryption at rest**: AES-256 minimum
- **Encryption in transit**: TLS 1.2+ mandatory
- **Access management**: Complete logging with timestamps

### Resident Rights
- **Right to portability**: Data export in readable format
- **Right to erasure**: Complete deletion within 30 days
- **Right of access**: Access to personal data held

### Breach Notification
- **Detection**: Automated monitoring systems
- **Notification deadline**: 72 hours to CAI
- **Documentation**: Detailed breach registry

## 6. Development Impact

### Technical Architecture
```typescript
// Example region configuration
const dbConfig = {
  region: 'ca-central-1', // Canada Central (Montreal)
  encryption: 'AES256',
  backupRegion: 'ca-central-1',
  accessLogging: true,
  logRetentionDays: 365
};
```

### Required Endpoints
- `GET /api/users/{id}/export` - Data export
- `DELETE /api/users/{id}/data` - Data deletion
- `POST /api/incidents/breach` - Automated breach reporting

### Contracts and Documentation
- Data Processing Agreements (DPA) with all vendors
- Privacy Impact Assessments (PIA)
- "Comparable protection" documentation
