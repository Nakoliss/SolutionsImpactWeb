# Operational Instructions for AI Coder
1. Work phase by phase; do not start next phase until acceptance criteria artifacts exist.
2. After each task, mark it `[X]` with a short note (date + summary).
3. If blocked (missing context/decision), create a `BLOCKERS.md` entry and pause phase.
4. Keep commits small: one logical task per commit.
5. Commit message convention: `feat:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `perf:`, `fix:`.
6. Run lint + typecheck before every commit; run build before phase completion.
